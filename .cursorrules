# Kanban Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview

This is a **local-only kanban board** application. No user authentication, no backend, no database. All data persists in the browser (e.g., localStorage).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **UI:** React 19
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **State:** React state / localStorage for persistence

## Scope Boundaries

- **No auth:** Do not add login, signup, sessions, or user accounts
- **No backend:** No API routes for data; keep everything client-side
- **No database:** Use localStorage (or similar) for persistence
- **Local first:** Single-user, single-machine use only

## Project Structure

```
app/
  layout.tsx          # Root layout
  page.tsx            # Main kanban board view
  globals.css         # Global styles, Tailwind
components/
  board/              # Kanban board components
  column/             # Column components
  card/               # Card/task components
  ui/                 # Reusable UI primitives
lib/
  storage.ts          # localStorage helpers
  types.ts            # Shared TypeScript types
```

## Code Conventions

### File Naming

- **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `Board.tsx`, `KanbanColumn.tsx`, `TaskCard.tsx`)
- **Utilities / lib:** camelCase (e.g., `storage.ts`, `types.ts`)
- **Folders:** lowercase, descriptive (e.g., `board`, `column`, `card`, `ui`)

### Component Patterns

- Use **client components** (`"use client"`) for interactive UI (drag-and-drop, forms, local state)
- Use **server components** only when there is no client interactivity
- Keep components small and focused; extract reusable pieces into `components/ui/`
- Prefer named exports for components; default exports for pages and layouts

### TypeScript

- Define interfaces/types in `lib/types.ts` for shared shapes (Board, Column, Card, etc.)
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` and type guards when types are uncertain
- Export types from a central module for consistency

### Styling (Tailwind)

- Prefer Tailwind utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary
- Use semantic color tokens from globals.css (`--background`, `--foreground`) when applicable
- Support dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme` (already in globals)
- Use consistent spacing scale (e.g., `gap-4`, `p-4`, `rounded-lg`)

### State & Persistence

- Store kanban data (columns, cards) in React state
- Sync to localStorage on changes; load from localStorage on mount
- Debounce or batch writes to localStorage when appropriate

## Kanban Domain

- **Board:** Contains one or more columns
- **Column:** Has a title and an ordered list of cards
- **Card:** Has a title, optional description, and belongs to one column

Keep the data model simple. Avoid over-engineering for features like labels, due dates, or comments unless explicitly requested.

## General Rules

1. **Consistency:** Match existing patterns, naming, and structure
2. **Simplicity:** Favor simple solutions; avoid unnecessary abstractions
3. **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML, focus states, and ARIA where relevant
4. **No breaking changes:** Preserve current scripts (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`)
